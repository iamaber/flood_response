# Flood Response Data Analysis

## About the Dataset

The dataset 'Flood_response.csv' comprises 3,774 records with 13 columns, capturing various aspects of flood response efforts. Key columns include:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each record (1-7,487)
- `gender`: Caller's gender (Unknown, Female, Male, O)
- `location_district`, `location_upazila`, `location_village`: Granular geographic information
- `caller_need`: Type of assistance required (Food, Rescue, Medicine)
- `status`: Request status (Pending, Resolved, etc.)
- `resolve_organization`: Organization handling the request
- `feedback_status`: Status of feedback received
- `resolve_comment`: Additional notes on resolution
- `created_at`: Timestamp of the request

## Key Analyses

1. **Distribution of Caller Needs Across Districts**
   - Noakhali district has the highest count of caller needs
   - Most other districts have relatively low counts
   - Needs are categorized into Food, Rescue, and Medicine

2. **Resolution Status by Gender**
   - Majority of cases for both males and females are pending
   - 'Unknown' gender category has a high number of resolved cases
   - Minimal data for 'O' gender category

3. **Trends in Call Volume Over Time**
   - Data spans from August 23, 2024, to September 10, 2024
   - Significant spike in calls on August 26, 2024 (418 calls)
   - Lowest number of calls on August 30, 2024 (10 calls)

4. **Correlation Between Caller Need and Feedback Status**
   - High frequency of 'Unknown' and 'Got no help' feedback statuses
   - Consistent feedback patterns across most caller need categories

5. **Common Needs in Districts with High Unresolved Cases**
   - Top districts: Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Cumilla, Comilla
   - Food is the primary need across all districts
   - Rescue needs reported only in Feni and Cumilla

6. **Resolution Time Across Different Caller Needs**
   - Analysis of how quickly different types of needs are addressed

7. **Feedback Status Trends Over Time**
   - Tracking changes in feedback statuses throughout the response period

8. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Heatmap visualization of relationships between various factors

9. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Linear regression model to predict caller needs for the next two days
   - Prediction: ~19-20 calls per day for the next two days

## Visualizations

The analysis includes various visualizations:
- Bar charts for distribution of needs across districts
- Stacked bar charts for resolution status by gender
- Line charts for call volume trends
- Heatmaps for correlation analyses
- Violin plots for resolution time distribution

## Conclusions

- Noakhali district requires focused attention due to high volume of needs
- There's a significant backlog of pending cases across genders
- Call volumes show high variability, with notable spikes
- Food is the most common need across all heavily affected districts
- Predictive modeling can aid in resource allocation for future response efforts

This analysis provides valuable insights for improving flood response strategies and resource allocation in affected areas.
